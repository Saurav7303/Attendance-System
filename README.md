# Attendance-System

Real-Time Face Recognition Attendance System

This project is a Real-Time Attendance System that uses Face Detection and Recognition to automatically mark attendance when a face is detected.

🔹 Features

Detects faces in real-time using a webcam.

Automatically marks attendance when a registered face is recognized.

Stores and manages attendance records efficiently.

🔹 Tech Stack / Libraries Used

OpenCV (cv2) → For face detection, image processing, and real-time camera input.

NumPy → For numerical operations and handling image data arrays.

Pickle → For saving and loading trained face recognition models.

OS → For handling file paths, directories, and system-level operations.

🔹 How it Works

The system captures live video feed from the webcam.

Detects and recognizes faces using pre-trained data.

Once a face is recognized, attendance is marked automatically with timestamp.

Records are saved for further use.

“This is an AI/ML based project built with Python.”
